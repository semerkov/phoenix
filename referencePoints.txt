THEORY
* Individual 		: A candidate solution to the problem
* Chromosomes 		: Properties of an individual which change during evolution
* Fitness Function 	: Objective function which needs to be optimized
* Generation		: An iteration in the evolution of the process where the fittest 
					  individuals' genome is modified (recombined and mutated) to produce 
					  a new offspring (individual) for the next generation 

IMPLEMENTATION
* set Depth in ComputerPlayer
* Change the constructor for Evaluate from ComputerPlayer -> Search
